    1. Why did we pass the struct as a reference variable?
	Because we need to modify the original variable to be able to pass it to the writeReport function.
    2. Why did we declare it as const?
    	So the function does not corrupt the value of the argument (i.e. try
	to convert it to a float or a double (?))
    3. Does it make sense to do both? Explain why it does or does not.
    	Doing both cuts down on overhead and memory usage because a copy of
	the variable isn't made.  Also, as
	previously stated, passing the struct by reference allows the function
	to modify the original variable so that it can be passed to other
	functions.  Declaring the struct as const is a safety measure to
	prevent the function from modifying the original argument, altering
	the argument's value, as passing by reference allows the function
	access to the original argument. 

I was struggling with input/output file processing for awhile, but after this
assignment I finally feel like I have a better grasp on it. 
One of my worries is the formatting for output, I feel like the way I'm doing
it looks ugly or inelegant and I'm wondering if there's a better way to format
output.

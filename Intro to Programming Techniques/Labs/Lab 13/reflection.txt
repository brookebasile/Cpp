This lab really helped my understanding of arrays and how they are handled in
memory.  At first I did not read the paragraph that states to create a
separate variable for the array size and was getting blank values after the
list of candidates.  It took me awhile to figure out what was going on, but
when I did I felt silly for missing it, but I'll definitely remember why that
error was happening from this point forward. 
Also, going back to type casting-- I forgot to convert one of the integers in
the percent calculation expression to a double and was getting incorrect
values.  Again, troubleshooting this problem reinforced my knowledge.

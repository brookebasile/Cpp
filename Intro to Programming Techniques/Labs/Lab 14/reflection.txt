This lab was challenging for me, but it was fun.  I feel like I learned a lot
about not only vectors, but also text file processing and handling characters.
Initially I struggled with how to read the data from the file into a struct
and then initialize that struct in the vector.  I asked for some assistance in
a C++ Discord server I'm in and on Stackoverflow.  I ended up learning 3
different ways to do it; the "expected" way using only the material we've
covered in class so far, defining the ">> operator" for the struct Parts, and
another method using istream.  So all in all this was a great learning
experience for me.
